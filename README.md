# Spring Boot Web Application - Learning Summary

## What I Learned

This project taught me how to build web applications using Spring Boot, following a complete tutorial series from basics to advanced concepts.

### Core Spring Boot Concepts
- **Project Creation**: How to create and structure a Spring Boot web application
- **MVC Architecture**: Understanding Model-View-Controller pattern for web development
- **Controllers**: Building web controllers to handle user requests and REST APIs
- **Data Handling**: Passing data between controllers and views using Model objects

### Web Development with Thymeleaf
- **Templates**: Creating dynamic HTML pages using Thymeleaf template engine
- **Directives**: Using if statements, loops (each/foreach), and links in templates
- **Data Display**: Showing lists and conditional content to users

### HTTP Request Handling
- **URL Parameters**: Getting data from URLs using @RequestParam and @PathVariable
- **POST Requests**: Handling JSON data submissions via REST APIs
- **Request Objects**: Working with HttpServletRequest for advanced scenarios

### Application Configuration
- **Properties**: Managing configuration using application.properties files
- **Value Injection**: Injecting configuration values with @Value annotation
- **Spring Expression Language**: Using SpEL for dynamic configuration
- **Environment**: Reading configurations programmatically

### Deployment & Operations
- **Port Configuration**: Changing default server port from 8080
- **DTO Pattern**: Using Data Transfer Objects for clean data handling
- **Response Types**: Returning redirects, forwards, and different HTTP responses
- **Deployment**: Running and deploying applications from terminal and IDE

This hands-on experience provided a solid foundation in Spring Boot web development, covering both traditional web applications and REST APIs.
