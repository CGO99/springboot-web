# Spring Boot Web Application - Learning Summary

This project follows a step-by-step learning path for building a web application using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. It covers key topics such as MVC architecture, controllers, REST APIs, DTOs, configuration using .properties files, and deployment with Maven. The project also demonstrates how to handle form data, URL parameters, and JSON requests, while making use of annotations like @RequestMapping, @PathVariable, @ModelAttribute, and more.


### Core Spring Boot Concepts
- **Project Creation**: How to create and structure a Spring Boot web application
- **MVC Architecture**: Understanding Model-View-Controller pattern for web development
- **Controllers**: Building web controllers to handle user requests and REST APIs
- **Data Handling**: Passing data between controllers and views using Model objects

### Web Development with Thymeleaf
- **Templates**: Creating dynamic HTML pages using Thymeleaf template engine
- **Directives**: Using if statements, loops (each/foreach), and links in templates
- **Data Display**: Showing lists and conditional content to users

### HTTP Request Handling
- **URL Parameters**: Getting data from URLs using @RequestParam and @PathVariable
- **POST Requests**: Handling JSON data submissions via REST APIs
- **Request Objects**: Working with HttpServletRequest for advanced scenarios

### Application Configuration
- **Properties**: Managing configuration using application.properties files
- **Value Injection**: Injecting configuration values with @Value annotation
- **Spring Expression Language**: Using SpEL for dynamic configuration
- **Environment**: Reading configurations programmatically

### Deployment & Operations
- **Port Configuration**: Changing default server port from 8080
- **DTO Pattern**: Using Data Transfer Objects for clean data handling
- **Response Types**: Returning redirects, forwards, and different HTTP responses
- **Deployment**: Running and deploying applications from terminal and IDE

This hands-on experience provided a solid foundation in Spring Boot web development, covering both traditional web applications and REST APIs.
